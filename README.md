# Wanda Challenge Backend

## Assumptions 🤔

* Create a backend for the search tool directory which uses Nightmare JS to scrape website H1, H2, and H3 tags. 

## If I had more time ⏰:

* Currently, the website is hard-coded within the .goto in Nightmare. Find a way to dynamically add any website from front-end. 
* After submit, Nightmare JS window pops up. Remove the pop-up. 
* Allow server to run and refresh while adding new profiles (names and websites).

## 💻 Getting Started 💻

1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the npm install command.
3. Start the web server using node server.js. 
4. Head over to http://localhost:3000/ for the search directory and add any name and the website www.lighthouselabs.ca. Will have to reset the server and refresh front-end to add another test site.
